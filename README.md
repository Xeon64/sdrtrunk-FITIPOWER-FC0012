Added support for FITIPOWER FC0012

If you have a FITIPOWER FC0012 or FC0013 that doesn't work with this driver let me know. Include bus a ID of the device.. and any other info you can spare.

FC0012 has been tested by me and will be updated more at later date.

Make sure you find your PPM using GQRX tuned to a Control Channel.  kalibarate-rtl or rtl_test etc.. will NOT work without modification.
